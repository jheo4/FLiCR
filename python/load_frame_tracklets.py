    Loads dataset labels also referred to as tracklets, saving them individually for each frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_frames    : Number of frames in the dataset.
    xml_path    : Path to the tracklets XML.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple of dictionaries with integer keys corresponding to absolute frame numbers and arrays as values. First array
    contains coordinates of bounding box vertices for each object in the frame, and the second array contains objects
    types as strings.
